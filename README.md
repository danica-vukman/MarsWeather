# MarsWeather

Sadly, the API used in this project no longer works. I shall leave the project here because I enjoyed making it.

This was a final project I did for an Android certification at a local school. I didn't really learn much from them that I didn't already know so I wanted this to be over as soon as possible, so it was done in about 10 hours. I found the [MAAS API](http://ingenology.github.io/mars_weather_api/) in a tutorial and I decided that it was a good test project. Our teacher mentioned Volley so I decided to use it for my app. I also added a flickr API for some Mars-y visuals. The person grading my project seemed to be satisfied with it, I went way beyond what they wanted us to do, but since the requirements were really low, I didn't do a lot. I passed and got my certification, which as of yet has not gotten me a job. Money (un)well spent. The projects requirements didn't require the app to be really responsive or anything, so it doesn't look really good, the course teachers were convinced design portion of programming for Android is useless, but I had to educate our teacher on what a FAB is, so, y'know, what did I expect, really.
