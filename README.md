# MarsWeather

This was a final project I did for an Android certification at a local school some years ago. I found the [MAAS API](http://ingenology.github.io/mars_weather_api/) in a tutorial and I decided that it was a good and fun test project. Our teacher mentioned Volley so I decided to use it for my app. I also added a flickr API for some Mars-y visuals. The project requirements were surprisingly low and the instructors were convinced that teaching us about design is pointless, so the app only showcases the basics of using APIs, libraries and networking, which were some of the optional requirements. I passed

Sadly, the API used in this project no longer works. It was fun to make though.
